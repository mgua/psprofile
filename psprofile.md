Marco Guardigli, october 2023

Allows team definition and management of powershell aliases to automate tasks,
for windows users.

## Installation
Open a powershell prompt and, from your home folder, execute the following commands
```
    mkdir psprofile
    cd psprofile
    git clone https://github.com/mgua/psprofile.git
    . .\profile.ps1
```

Check the code for the defined aliases, and define yours
once done, put your profile.ps1 in your Documents folder
and it will be automatically loaded by powershell once you open a prompt
